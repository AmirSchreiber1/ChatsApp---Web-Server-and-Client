# ChatsApp---Web-Server-and-Client
The ChatsApp project, part of the "Advanced Programming" course at Bar-Ilan University, is a web application that enables real-time communication between users. Built with React for the client-side, the app features signup, login, and chats pages. It uses a RESTful API for server-client communication, with the server side developed in Node.js and MongoDB for data storage. The app also supports real-time communication using WebSockets with Socket.IO.
